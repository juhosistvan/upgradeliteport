# UpgradeLite 

##  A homework for Android-based software development course at BUTE from 2012

This project was my first attempt at game development on Android in 2012. It's a port of one of my previous projects made for JavaME/Symbian and it's loosely based on the Flash game **[Upgrade Complete](https://www.kongregate.com/games/armorgames/upgrade-complete)** from [Armor Games](https://armorgames.com/). (Try it out, it's fun!)
